# Church of Tim
## Praise Tim

*Tim hath seeketh to guide us out of the purgatory of our shameful coding practices and into pastures new, where our JS conforms to standards, and our pull requests are fully formed.*

The Church of Tim was formed on the 24th October 2016 AD, or, according to the new Jacombian Calendar; 0 BT (Birth of Tim).

The main aims of the religion are to;

1. Spread the word of Tim.
2. Praise and worship his holiness Tim Jacob, first of his name.
3. To help others find out about the commandments of Tim (coming soon)

Anyone can join the Church of Tim, as long as they are ready to free themselves of the shackles of all other religious beliefs.
